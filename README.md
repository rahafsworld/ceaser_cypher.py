This is a simple Caesar Cipher tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
-Features-
Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input word by a specified amount to create an encrypted message.
Decryption: Reverses the shift to return the encrypted message back to the original word.
Error Handling: Handles invalid characters and ensures the direction is either 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'.
